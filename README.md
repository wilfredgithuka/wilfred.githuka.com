This blog/website is devoted to low level, backward-compatible electronic projects which would really be considered obsolete in todays digital
world. I care about such knowledge because its the building blocks of most of what we use today. I will do my best to ensure the information
that I publish is correct and also credit the source of information.

## Installation

Because this is a minimal static website powered by Go, you can have a copy of the entire content.

Just do a simple git clone and you are done.

I have moved the blog to a new git repo. So some posts images are still not available, but I will soon add them.

Trying to keep the blog's size to below 15MB incl of images. [minimalism]
