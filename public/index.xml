      <description>As I read more about Armateur Radio, am beginning to be more aware of major wireless transmission sites around me. One of such is the Ngong GV 115.9 VOR DME.
This is a huge circular beacon located on your way up to Ngong Hills just as you descend the second hill past the wind turbines. This equipment is is fenced and its very important for pilots as they navigate towards JKIA Airport.</description>

      <description>C might be regarded as an old low level langage but it actually is very powerful.
A databse can be created very easily in C. The following is a manual on how to create a simple database in C.
This code is available in my github repo :-)
Heap vs Stack Allocation Understanding the difference between heap and stack is very important for this tutorial.
A chunk of RAM can be on heap or stack.</description>

      <description>The Raspberry Pi Model A Revision 2.0 is a really classic device. On of the early devices to be made in early 2011 and its still working upto this date.
I have been having it for a while but these days I normally use it for learning purposes, mostly a general purpose computer.
This manual is for those who dont have a HDMI or RCA cable for setup. I will be connecting it up on a serial port which is quite handy.</description>

      <title>Sizeof-Ex12:Size&amp;Arrays in C</title>
      <link>https://wilfred.githuka.com/post/sizeof/</link>

      <guid>https://wilfred.githuka.com/post/sizeof/</guid>
      <description>The main objective of this exercise is to learn about sizeof and how it relates to arrays.
C strings are just arrays of bytes.
Sizeof is a unirary operator and C developers are obsessed about size of everything. In C memory size is key and you have to be keen on learning how much space is being taken up by stuff.
See the following code snippet:
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { int areas[] = {10, 12, 13, 14, 20}; char name[] = &amp;quot;Zed&amp;quot;; char full_name[] = {&#39;Z&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;d&#39;,&#39; &#39;,&#39;A&#39;,&#39;.</description>

      <description>The Epson L850 is a versatile printer that I came accross recently. Its the kind of printers that carry along an ink tank which is good but abit messy when it comes to refilling it.
Driver Installation This Driver installation tutorial is for Linux users specifically Archlinux. Am assuming that the connection media to the printer is via a USB 2.0 cable.
 Update your machine.  pacman -Syu  Install Epson Inkjet Printer Driver (ESC/P-R) for Linux.</description>

      <title>Exercise 2: Using Makefiles to Build</title>
      <link>https://wilfred.githuka.com/post/ex2/</link>

      <guid>https://wilfred.githuka.com/post/ex2/</guid>
      <description>Make has been around for a while. In software development, Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program. Though integrated development environments and language-specific compiler features can also be used to manage a build process, Make remains widely used, especially in Unix and Unix-like operating systems.
Read: man make for more information.</description>

      <description>In this second exercise, its all about writing code and seeing what happens. Click here for the tutorial&#39;s index page.
This is the code snippet for this exercise.
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; /*This is a comment*/ int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { int distance = 100; //This is another comment printf(&amp;quot;You are %d miles away \n&amp;quot;, distance); return 0; } Compiling To compile it you have to use make. GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program&#39;s source files.</description>

      <description>This is ground zero for the tutorial. But before starting any developent using C, you need to prepare your computer to make sure you have the necessary tools. This tutorial is for an Archlinux machine, which am using.
The Linux kernel and the GNU userland are written primarily in C. Arch Linux uses the GNU C Library (glibc) as the C standard library; it is a dependency of the base meta package.</description>

What is C?  C is broken, so I have to fix it. C is a preety UGLY and at the same time BEAUTIFUL Language Understand Undefined Behaviour Here is a long explanation of what C is:  C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations.</description>

      <description>The ExGNU Radio project is a skilling-up practical project to improve my soldering skills. Its a simple to complex kind of project which starts out simple and ends up being more complex as I dive deeper.
For sometime I have had these cheap Chinese-made FM &amp;amp; Tape deck receivers which also happens to have an Memory-Card reader section. The integration of these major sections is so poor that tt keeps breaking down.</description>

      <description>A Switched Mode Power supply is one of the most efficient ways to step down AC to DC which can be used by domestic appliances like mobile chargers, laptops and pcs. Its an advancement from liner power supplies and this technology has seen wall chargers get smaller and more efficient.
In the most simple definition, an smps is a type of power supply that uses semi-conductor devices&amp;rsquo; switching techniques rather than the standard linear methods to provide a stable reliable and safe output voltage.</description>

      <description>Located right at the floor of the Rift Valley is one less talked about sites in Kenya. Infact many trekkers of Mt.Longonot will briefly mention it or perhaps see it in the distance, not giving it much thought either.
The station is located South of Mt. Longonot which is 60kms from the capital, Nairobi.
The Longonot Earth Station is a specialised terrestrial terminal used to communicate with satellites in space. The two large satellite sites were built in 1970 and 1990 respectively and were used by the East African countries under the then East African Exchange Telecommunications (Extelcoms).</description>

      <description>IoU is an acronym for Interestion over Union, a type of semantic segemtation used in the identification of objects. This is a very important tool for autonomous vehicles to not only identify objects, but also to recognise them apart from other objects.
Wikipedia defines IOU as: The Jaccard index, also known as Intersection over Union and the Jaccard similarity coefficient (originally coined coefficient de communauté by Paul Jaccard), is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets.</description>

It&#39;s also something your average user might want to have enabled for reporting bugs, taking screenshots (though the new photo edit mode is good for that as well) and for mod users who want to see if that new mod he installed has any issues.</description>

      <description>I managed to solve the driving-in-a straight line by calculating the trajectory of the vehicle instead of directly feeding the trajectory as I had done earler. This can be seen in the image below.
But now I have developed another problem such that my vehicle is hitting other cars on the same lane. I thought I would be able to solve this by reducing the value of dist_inc down to 0.</description>

Am down here on assignment with AVIC Kenya at Coast Institute of Technology where we are conducting a training for various TVET teachers in a Mechatronic Engineering course which is being offered in Chinese by Chinese teachers. This training has been running for the last 3 months so am just here for the last 1 month or so as an interpreter for Chinese&amp;ndash;English and vice versa.</description>

      <description>Ranger, developed by Roman Zimbelman is an ncurses based powerful filemanager for UNIX-like systems. Its free relased under GNU GPL Licence. It can do what most GUI file managers can do with less effort. It was first released in 2010 the latest version is of 2017 February. And its written in Python.
The coolest part is that its 260KB only, how about that :-)
And yes I know that the photo above has no relation to Ranger, its the Nairobi National Park and I think it looks cool.</description>

      <description>The IBM Selectric typewriter a machine that was as a result of &amp;ldquo;Seven years of research&amp;rdquo; was one of the best machines ever sold back in 1961. The Selectric was so popular that it captured 75% of the american market. It was only replaced by the electronic one which IBM later made.
The great sound of this machine can be relived in spacemacs through a cool layer that was developed by Sylvain Benner.</description>

      <description>Ever since I went deep into Linux in 2015, I have heard of emacs being mentioned as the holy grail of Linux text editing. I must admit but it looked messy and had to grasp.
Early this year I came accross Spacemacs and it looked interesting but just like emacs I gave it a glance and planned to give it more time.
A month ago I saw my pal Raymond navigate his Linux box effortlessly using a similar software appearance quicly editing and opening files in what seemed like a spectactular fun.</description>

      <description>Today is one of the best days of my life. When I saw the email from Udacity that I have bee accepted for the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program, I was elated. This is an online program that teaches one how to develop the necessary software and skills that a self driving system uses.
I learnt about the Nanodgree back in Dec of 2016 when I was starting to learn Python and this was the goal of that project.</description>

      <description>After fiddling around and some long hours setting up my server, I managed to install Wordpress on Caddy.For those who have not used Caddy before, you can read more about it on Caddyserver.
Its awesome since it gives you a https (security) for your domain. Caddy is praised by industry experts for security defaults and unpararelleld usability.

      <description>The sound of drifing wind and background noise of students discussing in low tones is the relative ambience that I observed for the short duration that I was in Nyeri Baptist School. I cannot forget to mention the fact that apart from the normal mobile network, the air seemed electrically clean. No numerous untamed, unmanaged wifi signals roaming in the air that we soak in daily in Nairobi. It was just the best condusive environment for knowledge.</description>

      <description>I go to BSF on Monday evenings to Westlands St Marks Church and the drive there with my friends provides a good chance to collect some data for my self driving car programme. My data collection device is still my mobile phone mounted on the dashboard. I have explained how to do this in my previous post.
Yesterday&#39;s run was like normal but over the last 3 weeks, my videos have been appearing with some darkness which is as a result from the mounting angle facing the road.</description>

      <description>Ever since I dipped my mind into the autonomous vehicles world, I have been noting carefully road transport in a whole new dimension. I now see data and need lots of it. Training a CNN needs alot of data and even when I was working on the Lane Detection Algo project, I used data that was provided by (Udacity)[udacity.com]. But now I deceided to put the same algo on local roads here in Kenya.</description>

      <description>This past week has had quite some significant developments in the autonomous car industry. The big companies are still leading the pack though some have decided to cut back in developments. Seizing this opportunity, small startups are rising by launching market ready self driving cars promising to make them ready by 2020.

      <description>I stepped into my first Chinese class in May 2012 at Kenyatta University Confucius Institute and I have been using Chinese professionally as from September 2014 when I landed my first translation job at the Standard Gauge Railway. Speakig Chinese is natural for me but not the idioms which are a headache. Speaking like a Chinese native requires alot of time and preactise, something that many non natives dont have time.</description>

      <description>The main objective of this project is to find lane lines in video using basic computer vision. The lines on the road show us where the lanes are and act as a constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.In this project I have created a pipeline to detect lane lines in images and videos using Python and OpenCV.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s Shack meeting was best attended than another since I joined ARSK. This was mainly due to the recent developments at the shack. The home-less guy that we chased from living behind the shack wrecked havoc on the shack. He smashed the windows, destroyed the supports that hold the veranda&#39;s roofing which eventually came crashing down. There were signs of attempted forced entry from the rear door but once again the bees deterred him.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s Shack meeting was well attended. We had 4 members present including our Chairman, Mr Ted Alleyne. Other members present were Mr. Joseph Ngungu and Mr. Kagotho. We arrived to find that somebody had stolen the water meter and left the water flooding the entire place. I plugged the pipe with a stick and I hope it holds till its repaired. Also the guy who lives behind the shack has made the hole in the fence bigger since thats his passage, we took down his makeshift dwelling because he had littered the place with plastic bottles.</description>

      <guid>https://wilfred.githuka.com/post/growing-plants-with-articial-light/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The intensity of light radiating from a point source that reaches a surface is inversely proportional to the square of the surface&#39;s distance from the source - Inverse square law. This simply means that if an object is twice as far away it receives only a quarter of the light.
This is the basis of this experiment. For a long time we have relied on the sun as the source of food, but with recent scientific studies, man has stared to grow plants indoors with the help of artificial light from bulbs.</description>

The hole on the fence is even bigger.The station is overgrown with grass due to the heavy rains that have been pounding Nairobi lately. As usual Ted kicked off the meeting and went through the meeting. At some point we were discussing how one can call the ISS (International Space Station). I later did some research and this is what I have learn&#39;t.</description>

      <description>Today was my first time to attend a shack meeting and generally it was very informative. The meeting was at the 5Z4RS Station Beacon in Woodley Estate,Nairobi. This location is referred to as the Shack. On my way I was wondering who and what type of people I would find. The meeting was scheduled to start at 10.00AM. On arrival I found Mr.Ted Alleyne together with another gentle man doing some preparations.</description>

      <description>Introduction Armature Radio (Ham Radio) is a hobby for enthusiasts which is a non commercial radio station with 4 receivers, amplifier and additional equipment for communication with other operators on a specific frequency. In Kenya ham radio is organized by Radio Society of Kenya located in Nairobi where they have a headquarters. Although Amateur Radio operators get involved for many reasons, they all have in common a basic knowledge of radio technology and operating principles, and pass an examination for the FCC license to operate on radio frequencies known as the &amp;ldquo;Amateur Bands.</description>

      <description>Located SW of Nairobi is Kenya&#39;s largest Wind Farm, Ngong Hills. The word &amp;ldquo;Ngong&amp;quot;as I was told by the locals is an Anglicization of a Maasai phrase &amp;ldquo;enkong&#39;u emuny&amp;rdquo; meaning rhinoceros spring, and this name derives from a spring located near Ngong Town. Overlooking the Great Rift Valey on the Western Slopes, the Nong Hills rise to 2,460 meters above sea level.During the years of British colonial rule, the area around the Ngong Hills was a major settler farming region, and many traditional colonial houses are still seen in the area.</description>
