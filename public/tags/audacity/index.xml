      <description>The Marantz Pro MPM-1000U is a USB condenser mic for DAW recording or podcasting. It comes in as an entry level mic.It comes with a USB connection which was one of the feature that I wanted. This mic is designed to work on any PC with a descent USB interface and a software like Audacity.
While thats good, I wanted to try out recording on termial and this is how far I have come in doing so.</description>
