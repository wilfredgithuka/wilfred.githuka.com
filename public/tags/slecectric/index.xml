      <description>The IBM Selectric typewriter a machine that was as a result of &amp;ldquo;Seven years of research&amp;rdquo; was one of the best machines ever sold back in 1961.

The great sound of this machine can be relived in spacemacs through a cool layer that was developed by Sylvain Benner.</description>
