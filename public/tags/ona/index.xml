      <description>Today was the last meetup of Nailug - Nairobi Linux User Group. As usual for the past few months, the meetup was held at Ona who have continued to support us bu giving us a space to hold our meetups. Today&amp;rsquo;s talk was about HTTP/2 which was presented by Kenneth Gitere from Ona. The topic was - HTTP/2 to be or not to be.
