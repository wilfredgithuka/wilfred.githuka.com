      <description>Today is one of the best days of my life. When I saw the email from Udacity that I have bee accepted for the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program, I was elated. This is an online program that teaches one how to develop the necessary software and skills that a self driving system uses.
I learnt about the Nanodgree back in Dec of 2016 when I was starting to learn Python and this was the goal of that project.</description>
