      <description>The sound of drifing wind and background noise of students discussing in low tones is the relative ambience that I observed for the short duration that I was in Nyeri Baptist School.

No numerous untamed, unmanaged wifi signals roaming in the air that we soak in daily in Nairobi. It was just the best condusive environment for knowledge.</description>
