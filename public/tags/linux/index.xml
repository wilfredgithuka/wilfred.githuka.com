      <description>Today was the last meetup of Nailug - Nairobi Linux User Group. As usual for the past few months, the meetup was held at Ona who have continued to support us bu giving us a space to hold our meetups. Today&#39;s talk was about HTTP/2 which was presented by Kenneth Gitere from Ona. The topic was - HTTP/2 to be or not to be.

      <description>Ranger, developed by Roman Zimbelman is an ncurses based powerful filemanager for UNIX-like systems. Its free relased under GNU GPL Licence. It can do what most GUI file managers can do with less effort. It was first released in 2010 the latest version is of 2017 February. And its written in Python.
The coolest part is that its 260KB only, how about that :-)
And yes I know that the photo above has no relation to Ranger, its the Nairobi National Park and I think it looks cool.</description>

      <description>Ever since I went deep into Linux in 2015, I have heard of emacs being mentioned as the holy grail of Linux text editing. I must admit but it looked messy and had to grasp.
Early this year I came accross Spacemacs and it looked interesting but just like emacs I gave it a glance and planned to give it more time.
A month ago I saw my pal Raymond navigate his Linux box effortlessly using a similar software appearance quicly editing and opening files in what seemed like a spectactular fun.</description>
