<p>The ExGNU Radio project is a skilling-up practical project to improve
my soldering skills. Its a simple to complex kind of project which
starts out simple and ends up being more complex as I dive deeper.</p>

<p>For sometime I have had these cheap Chinese-made FM &amp; Tape deck receivers
which also happens to have an Memory-Card reader section. The integration
of these major sections is so poor that tt keeps breaking down. Sometimes
I hit the top and it just works, what do these guys put in these devices.</p>

<p>These Multiband radio receiver FM/MW/SW 9 band portable radios are not
really designed to last long. Many fail due to power surges or just
low quality component used. Actually on <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Multiband-radio-receiver-FM-MW-SW_62168890368.html?spm=a2700.7724857.normalList.131.65616853rN0phL">Alibaba</a> you can order such for as
low as 4USD for a max of 2000 pieces.</p>

<p>So I have decided to redo the whole thing from scratch following the
circuit board that the manufacterer used to make my own. I will recycle
components to keep costs low and use other components from a simlar past
project.</p>

<p>The first part will be do document the circuit board using a camera by taking
really high def images of the circuit board then listing all the components
down. This I did well. There are also surface mount components which are really not easy to work with due to ther size.</p>

<p><img src="/img/smd.JPG" alt="smd" /></p>

<p>^ The SMD components side.</p>

<p><img src="/img/old.JPG" alt="old" /></p>

<p>^ The ordinary discrete components. This board had a large number of capacitors.</p>

<h2 id="next-step">Next Step</h2>

<p>The next step is more of documentation of the components and classification. Also I plan to draw the circuit again and getting a chance to learn how to make one cheaply.</p>

<p>But at the moment I have started to see how I can reproduce the circuit on a
notebook, dividing it into various sections for better understanding.</p>
