Today is one of the best days of my life. When I saw the email from Udacity that
I have bee accepted for the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program, I was elated. This is an online program that teaches one how to develop the necessary software and skills that a self driving system uses.</p>

<p>I learnt about the Nanodgree back in Dec of 2016 when I was starting to learn Python and this was the goal of that project. Well, here it is. Even though I am excited, I cannot however start now, maybe a month later in December this year so that I can save up to get the funds to pay.</p>

<p>The course is USD800 per term of 3 term, with each term being 3 months long.</p>

<p>I have taked to Udacity and there is another co-hort that is starting in December 14th which I will be part off.</p>

<p>I am too excited to write alot so for now, I would like to thank the team at Udacity and David Silver for the opportunity which I will utilise to the best.</p>

<p>Thank you and see you in December :-)</p>
