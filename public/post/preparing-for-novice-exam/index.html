<p>Today&rsquo;s Shack meeting went well and was well attended. The hole on the fence is even bigger.The station is overgrown with grass due to the heavy rains that have been pounding Nairobi lately. As usual Ted kicked off the meeting and went through the meeting. At some point we were discussing how one can call the ISS (International Space Station). I later did some research and this is what I have learn&rsquo;t.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-contact-the-iss">How To Contact The ISS</h1>

<p>The ISS is the International Space Station.It is a habitable space satellite that is in orbit around the earth. Launched by rockets from earth, the ISS, launched in 1998, can be viewed by a naked eye from earth. Some ISS crew members make random, unscheduled, amateur radio voice contacts with earth-bound radio amateurs, often called &ldquo;hams&rdquo;. They can make radio contacts during their breaks, pre-sleep time and before and after mealtime. Astronauts have contacted thousands of hams around the world. The work schedules of the ISS crew dictate when they are able to operate the radios. The crew&rsquo;s usual waking period is 0730 - 1930 UTC. The most common times to find a crew member making casual periods are about one hour after waking and before sleeping, when they have personal time. They&rsquo;re usually free most of the weekend, as well.(The current crew work schedule is published on the NASA website.)</p>

<p>The crew can operate the 2-meter packet radio in unattended mode, and hams can make contacts with the ISS station when the crew members are working. Hams can also communicate with each other using the ISS packet (computer) radio mode, or receive slow scan television mode images. It all depends on what equipment is in service in space.</p>

<p>A typical ground station for contacting the ISS station includes a 2-meter FM transceiver and 25-100 watts of output power. A circularly polarized crossed-Yagi antenna capable of being pointed in both azimuth (North-South-East-West) and elevation (degrees above the horizon) is desirable. But successful contacts have even been made with vertical and ground plane antennas.</p>

<p>Preparing For Novice Exam
So next Month am going to sit for my Kenyan Novice Exam, so its now down to the facts of Ham Radio as I prepare for the exam.</p>
