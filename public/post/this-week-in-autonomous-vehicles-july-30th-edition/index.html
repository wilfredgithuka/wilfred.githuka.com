This week in the autonomous vehicle industry has been quite busy one. For me I have been doing alot of hardware work to improve on my hand on skills. My RC SD car has gained some progress despite my busy schedule
Now onto the news…</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="udacity">Udacity</h2>

<p>Upto 50% off on all Nanodegrees
Udacity has been having a busy week with the Udacity Discovery week which ended on 27th July. During the discovery week all Nanodegrees were 50% off. How about that. Here is a quote that summarizes it all.
“Literally thousands of new students have already enrolled, and are now ready to turn their Discovery Week savings into the most extraordinary learning experience of their lives.” 6000+ new enrollments.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-for-dummies-explained-in-3-mins">Machine Learning for dummies — explained in 3 mins!</h2>

<p>Yash Soni has written a great article about the basics of ML (Machine Learning) In his article he mentions about the common applications of ML i our day to day lives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your personal Assistant Siri or Google uses ML.</li>
<li>Weather predictions for the next week comes using ML.</li>
<li>Win Predictor in a sports tournament uses ML.</li>
<li>Medical Diagnosis dominantly uses ML.</li>
<li>And something you would be familiar with, ever wondered how come media sites shows you recommendations and ads matching closely to your interests? They as well use Machine Learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bit-coins">Bit Coins</h2>

<p>If you are into Bit currency but don’t know how to start, there is a great article buy Tess Rinearson using emoticons to explain it well. Her article is well written and illustrated. Worth checking out.</p>

<h2 id="self-driving-cars-will-affect-everything-you-know">Self-driving cars will affect everything you know</h2>

<p>Autonomous vs Traditional intersection</p>

<p>Aniket has written a noteworthy article about how self driving cars will affect everything we know. Here is an excerpt:</p>

<p>Lyft and Uber will be our go-to when it comes to moving from point A to point B. In an ideal world, where no one owns a car, everyone requests a ride through their phone. This means that the ride-sharing companies would own the cars themselves and manage them in fleets. These fleets would most likely be in dedicated parking lots which would serve as distribution centers. We’ll also rarely see cars sitting idle — they’ll always be on a route to some destination rather than being parked by a sidewalk, at a shopping mall, in a garage, and so on. When a car drops someone off, it goes on to the next customer or back to the distribution center for service or layoff during non-peak hours. Cars will be utilized more, but they’ll take up less space.
You can read the full article here…</p>

<p>Thats all for this week, have a great week ahead and stay safe while experimenting on self driving cars.</p>
