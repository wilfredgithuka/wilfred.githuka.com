The sound of drifing wind and background noise of students discussing in low
tones is the relative ambience that I observed for the short duration that I
was in Nyeri Baptist School. I cannot forget to mention the fact that apart
from the normal mobile network, the air seemed electrically clean. No numerous
untamed, unmanaged wifi signals roaming in the air that we soak in daily in
Nairobi. It was just the best condusive environment for knowledge.</p>
<p>Nyeri Baptist School is a mixed high school, located in Nyeri County.
It sits along the Nyeri-Nyahururu road, a 15minute drive from Nyeri town.
Our drive to Nyeri Baptist was by an invitation by the Christian Union to
Pastor Marvo to attend their handover ceremony which took place on Sunday,
following a night service on Saturday evening at the same venue - Chapel.</p>
<h2 id="saturday">Saturday</h2>
<p><img src="/img/nyeri/saturday.JPG" alt="saturday-image">
We left Church (Ruaraka Baptist Church) at 1pm and headed for Nyeri. The most
convinient route was highway A2 aka Thika Road. After a brief stop over at
Juja Mall, to buy some snacks, we continued the jpurney for Nyeri. The
higway is all smooth until some few kilometers past Thika town where surface
turns from a smooth bintumen to rough bumpy track and narrows down to a single
carriageway all the way to Nyeri. Occasinaly additional lanes appear especially
on hilly sections of the highway. Road marking are consistent all the way. I
noticed that from Nairobi to Nyeri we climbed in altitude.</p>
<p>Before arriving in Neri town we go accomodation at Green Edges Apartments,
located 2kms outside Nyeri town. These apartments are fully furnished. We got
a good apartment for all 6 of us constisting of 2 bedrooms, living room (with
tv),hot shower and kitchen, all furnished. The houses are clean, cosy and
have a wifi too which I had to sample.</p>
<p>It cost us each KES 1000 x 6 = 6000/- for the night.</p>
<p>After a brief rest we practised our vocals and left to the school which was
a 15 minite drive from there.</p>
<h2 id="nyeri">Nyeri</h2>
<p>In this section I will discuss some of my finding from key observations of
Nyeri town as we drive about. WARNING: I might deviate and go deep into some
stuff so if you are not interested, you can skip this section altogether to
the church section.</p>
<p>Nyeri is located in the central highlands of Kenya and its the headquarters
of Nyeri County.From Nairobi you will cover some 150km to reach Nyeri. The
town is between the Abadare Ranges and Mount Kenya both of which have
thick forests around them. Its cordinates are 0deg 25'S 36deg57'E and
the time zone is still UTC+3. I noticed that the town is dvided by a
large river valley of Chania River.</p>
<h2 id="sunday">Sunday</h2>
<p><img src="/img/nyeri/sunday.JPG" alt="sunday-image">
On Sunday we had a wonderful Sunday service at the chapel which was attended by
all the students. The hall was full of neatly dressed students. Today was the
handing over ceremony for the old and new Christian Union (CU) leadership.</p>
<p>The handover went well and so was the preaching. After the service we hanged
around as we talked with the students on carrer choices after high school.
The had numerous questions about life in the university.</p>
<p><img src="/img/nyeri/team.JPG" alt="team-image">
The team whom I was with from L-R:Joyce,Jackline and Irene.</p>
<p>One student who caught my attention was the outgoing CU Chairman who also was the deputy headboy. He appeared very bright and knowledgeable and very interesting to talk about various topics in science and engineering.</p>
<h2 id="the-chef">The Chef</h2>
<p>This topic seemed abit misplaced in this article but read on and you will find
out why. In Nyeri we met an old pal of Marvin who invitated us for dinner. He
lives some small distance from Nyeri town and together with his wife. They
cooked the best meal I have ever tasted in Kenya. So much was I drowned in the
flavours that I cant even recall the name of the food. Their house was very well decorated and it looked so original. The dining table was an authentic wood
that was well cut.</p>
