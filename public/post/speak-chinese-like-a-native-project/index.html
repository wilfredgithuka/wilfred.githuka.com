<p>I stepped into my first Chinese class in May 2012 at Kenyatta University Confucius Institute and I have been using Chinese professionally as from September 2014 when I landed my first translation job at the Standard Gauge Railway. Speakig Chinese is natural for me but not the idioms which are a headache. Speaking like a Chinese native requires alot of time and preactise, something that many non natives dont have time. When I was in China - Nanjing I spent quite some time recording any native speacker (with their permission) so that I would practise later on how they articulated their tones. This really helped me gain a good foundation in tones.</p>
<p>With time however, I gradually stopped due to time constrains and I feel now that am preparing for HSK Level 6 I need to restart this project. I still have the recordings and those will help me get back on my feet. This time I selected a small text from the Chinese Embassy in Nairobi&rsquo;s website which I used as a starting point. I sent the text to my Chinese teacher requesting her to read it and record her voice, which later she sent me as a .m4a file. M4A is a file extension for an audio file encoded with advanced audio coding (AAC) which is a lossy compression. M4A was generally intended as the successor to MP3, which had not been originally designed for audio only but was layer III in an MPEG 1 or 2 video files. M4A stands for MPEG 4 Audio. AAC or M4A file quality is better and file sizes smaller compared to MP3 files.</p>

<p>The following is what I will use as my benchmark. Its a lady&rsquo;s voice and since she is a professional Chinese teacher I thought she&rsquo;d be best to start with. Until I find a way to put the track on this wesite, you will have to listen to her on SoundCloud.</p>
