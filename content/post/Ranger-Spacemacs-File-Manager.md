Ranger, developed by Roman Zimbelman is an ncurses based powerful filemanager
for UNIX-like systems. Its free relased under GNU GPL Licence. It can do what
most GUI file managers can do with less effort. It was first released in 2010
the latest version is of 2017 February. And its written in Python.

The coolest part is that its 260KB only, how about that :-)

And yes I know that the photo above has no relation to Ranger, its the Nairobi
National Park and I think it looks cool.

### Spacemacs

To install it on spacemacs just add it to your spacemacs.d file and you can
start it from 

* ESC-m-a-r

To use it is very simple, if you have used the original one. It has the basic 
keys for navigation:

* h - Left
* j - Up
* k - Down
* l - Right

For usage docs I can refer you to [Ranger Home](ranger.nongnu.org)

Enjoy :-)
