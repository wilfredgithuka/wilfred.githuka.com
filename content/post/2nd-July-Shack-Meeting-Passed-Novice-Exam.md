# Gate and Shack Security
The fence for the shack has a big hole which unknown persons keep breaking into the shack. There is along process for this to be repaired. These people have now started 'dwelling' behind the building. We found a large stock of bottles behind the shack building. They have also broken the water pipe.
# Running Costs
The site has proved too expensive to maintain and we are thinking of changing location.

Here are some images of the current situation.
