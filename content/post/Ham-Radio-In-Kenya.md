# Introduction
Armature Radio (Ham Radio) is a hobby for enthusiasts which is a non commercial radio station with 4 receivers, amplifier and additional equipment for communication with other operators on a specific frequency. In Kenya ham radio is organized by [Radio Society of Kenya](http://www.qsl.net/arsk/index.htm) located in Nairobi where they have a headquarters. Although Amateur Radio operators get involved for many reasons, they all have in common a basic knowledge of radio technology and operating principles, and pass an examination for the FCC license to operate on radio frequencies known as the "Amateur Bands." 

These bands are radio frequencies allocated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for use by ham radio operators. In Kenya it is regulated by the [Communications Authority of Kenya](http://www.ca.go.ke/index.php/frequency-spectrum).The word "HAM" as applied to 1908 was the station CALL of the first amateur wireless station operated by some amateurs of the Harvard Radio Club. They were ALBERT S. HYMAN, BOB ALMY and POOGIE MURRAY. At first they called their station "HYMAN- ALMY-MURRAY".

# Location And Headquarters
The headquarters of ARSK is on Joseph Kangethe Road, Woodley Estate, Nairobi (off the Ngong Road.) Home of the Society station 5Z4RS.

# Licensing
1. Kenya citizens are required to submit a photocopy of the Pass Certificate of an acceptable RAE, or an acceptable, valid and current Full foreign license. The RSGB-administered IARE is the only available exam, which can be taken in Kenya twice a year under the supervision of RSK or another authorized examination centre. Non-citizen residents are required to submit a photocopy of a valid and current license issued by their own country of citizenship, and at present cannot obtain a Kenya license solely on the strength of a local IARE pass. Novice or "Above 30 MHz only" licenses will not be accepted for conversion.
* A photocopy of the passport showing the visa, or Kenya identity card.
Instead of supporting documents being certified by a Commissioner for Oaths or Notary Public, all local applicants must submit a sworn affidavit in the form attached to the application form on the CAK website.
* A Certificate of Good Conduct from the Kenya CID, or a similar document from their home country Police Force in the case of non-citizens, whose countries are also required to have diplomatic relations with Kenya.
* Two local references who must be members of RSK
* The completed application form must be submitted with the fee of KShs.1,000, photocopies of the license, passport and the affidavit with translations of documents where necessary
* The fee of KShs.2,000 is payable on issue of the license. To avoid heavy bank charges it is best to pay these fees in one as KShs.3,000.

* On approval for issue the fee is KShs.2,000 (about US$24).
* The whole may be paid as one lump sum (around US$37) which is likely to be cheaper in transfer charges than paying two separate amounts. Exchange rates are very variable and should be checked.
