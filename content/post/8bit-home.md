Building a computer from scratch is a crazy idea, given the small details
one has to be careful with. Also the time investment for debugging is immense.

But the learning content is incredible.

This is the reason why am starting this long journey of building an 8bit computer
from scratch. Am building mine from TTL chips using the kits provided by

## The Kit

The Complete Kit bundle retails at USD 269(Ksh.30,000).

This set of 4 kits, along with series of videos on YouTube will help you develop a deep understanding of how programmable CPUs really work.

This bundle includes:

* Clock module
* Registers and ALU
* RAM and program counter
* Output and control logic

See the descriptions for each kit for a complete list of parts included.

Note: Each kit includes schematic diagrams, but full assembly instructions are only provided through the YouTube videos. The kits include pointers to which videos to follow along with.

I bought my kit bundle and it took 3 weeks to arrive. Upon reaching the JKIA Airport there were some custom charges which came to about KES 16,000. I wouldn't recommend
this method, it waaaay too expensive.
