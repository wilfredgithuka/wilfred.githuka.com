According to the United Nations Environment Programme, 85 percent of the e-waste 
dumped in Ghana and other parts of West Africa is produced in Ghana and West Africa. 

In other words, ending the export of used electronics from the wealthy developed world 
wonâ€™t end the burning in Agbogbloshie.

In Kenya, the situation is the same, we buy many electromic devices of which get
disposed off after 2 or more years. We generate over 44 Mega Tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste) each year
items such as old laptops and phones that end up polluting the environment.
