I think finally I have the time to learn some Morse Code.

Morse Code is a an early rudimentary communication system developed by Samuel Morse, who also invented the Telegraph

Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs.

The International Morse Code encodes the 26 English letters A through Z, some non-English letters, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters.

Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dots and dashes. The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dash within a character is followed by period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dot duration.

My reason for learning this lies in the Radio interest and also just being able to understand what lies in this code is just amazing.

## Materials

Am using the following materials to pick up the skill. I try to avoid going online and I hope to use the same material until I complete the
course.

* ARRL Morse Code Training CD-1 and CD-2: A great tool, 130MB of audio lessons. This set includes two audio CDs (mp3) with nearly 2-1/2 hours of practice. Learn the Morse code at 5 words-per-minute. Follow the proven ARRL Morse code teaching system. Includes 2 audio CDs and instruction booklet.

I will add more recources as I progress on.
