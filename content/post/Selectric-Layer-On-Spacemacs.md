The IBM Selectric typewriter a machine that was as a result of "Seven years of
research" was one of the best machines ever sold back in 1961. The Selectric was

by the electronic one which IBM later made.

The great sound of this machine can be relived in spacemacs through a cool
layer that was developed by Sylvain Benner.
