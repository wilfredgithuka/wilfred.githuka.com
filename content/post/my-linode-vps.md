# Introduction

Finally after fiddling up with some settings, my Linode VPS is running perfectly. Before
going deeper let me explain what is a VPS. A VPS is a Virtual Private Server that 
is esentially a computer in a dfferent location where you can install programs while having
access to it via SSH or other protocols. A VPS (Virtual Private Server) is utilised by businesses 
looking for a secure method of hosting their websites. A VPS works in the same way a dedicated server 
does but without the high costs and are easier to configure to an individual businessâ€™s needs. You are 
still responsible for maintaining the server but it also means you can enjoy higher site traffic without 
worrying about things breaking. It allows more tweaking than your regular shared hosting.

# Pricing and Running Costs

My VPS is a Linode 1024. This comes with:

* 1GB RAM
* 1 CPU Core
* 20GB HDD
* 1TB Transfer

Monthly costs are USD 5 which is around KES 500 per month. This translates to KES 6,000 per
year. 

# Payment Methods

In Kenya not many banks support internet transactions and if they are, the costs are quite high.
There was the [Nation Hela](http://nationhela.com/) Card which is good but its going to be shudown, 
Then came the [Nakumatt Card](http://www.nakumattglobal.com/) which promised good online payement 
service but that too is unavailable. Both of there cards are supported by [DTB Bank Kenya](https://dtbk.dtbafrica.com/). 
The Airtel Money card looks promising and thats what I use.

The [Airtel Money VISA](http://africa.airtel.com/wps/wcm/connect/africarevamp/kenya/airtelmoney_old/offers/airtel-money-visa-card) card is an Airtel Money product powered by VISA and Chase bank. The Airtel Money 
debit card allows customers to:

* Withdrawal Airtel Money at any local VISA or Kenswitch ATM
* Withdrawal Airtel Money at any international VISA ATM
* Shop or make payments at any VISA accepting merchants worldwide
* Pay for Linode :-)

With the Airtel Money VISA card, its tied to your Airtel Money acount. To top us just deposit money
into your Airtel Money account and it will reflect on your card amount. With this you can add to 
your Paypal cards etc.

When paying for Linode VPS or any other VPSs they renew automatically. This means you need to have
at least KES 500 in your card per month which will be deducted automagically.

# Seting up a Linode VPS

This is probably the easiest VPS to set up. Just got o Linode.com, create am account and follow the simple
instructions how to pay for the VPS.

You can install most Linux distro's avalable with my best Archlinux at the top of the list.

And there you have it, your own server to tweak, hack, kill etc and learn alot of sysadmin stuff. I will
write more posts on how I use my Linode VPS
