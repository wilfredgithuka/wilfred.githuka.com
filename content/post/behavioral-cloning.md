### 5 Laps Forward Data 300MB
Using this data, I trained on 7 epochs and the car driove well but upon arriving at the bridge it was completely blank and just went for the wall. The passengers had minor injuries but the car suffered alot of exterior damage. This experiment was a failure. It was towed back to the garage. Cost to repair Ksh. 25,000
### Adding More Data
I recorded more training data by driving the car at a small distance since this was my recovery dataset. Udacity recomends driving outside the track and back so that the car knows what to do when such a situation arises.
