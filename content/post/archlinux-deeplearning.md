This post is as aresult of 3 weeks of terminal work, fiddling with my Archlinu installation tring to install CUDA. In the process I have learnt quite a couple of deep stuff in the linux environment and I also know that I might have broken something inside there which will come to haunt me later.

### My Hardware
GPU: Nvidia GTX 1050 with 640 CUDA cores and 7Gbs memory speed
CPU: Intel Core i7
RAM: 16GB
OS: Archlinux
