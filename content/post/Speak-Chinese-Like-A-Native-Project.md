I stepped into my first Chinese class in May 2012 at Kenyatta University Confucius Institute and I have been using Chinese professionally as from September 2014 when I landed my first translation job at the Standard Gauge Railway. Speakig Chinese is natural for me but not the idioms which are a headache. Speaking like a Chinese native requires alot of time and preactise, something that many non natives dont have time. When I was in China - Nanjing I spent quite some time recording any native speacker (with their permission) so that I would practise later on how they articulated their tones. This really helped me gain a good foundation in tones. 

With time however, I gradually stopped due to time constrains and I feel now that am preparing for HSK Level 6 I need to restart this project. I still have the recordings and those will help me get back on my feet. This time I selected a small text from the Chinese Embassy in Nairobi's website which I used as a starting point. I sent the text to my Chinese teacher requesting her to read it and record her voice, which later she sent me as a .m4a file. M4A is a file extension for an audio file encoded with advanced audio coding (AAC) which is a lossy compression. M4A was generally intended as the successor to MP3, which had not been originally designed for audio only but was layer III in an MPEG 1 or 2 video files. M4A stands for MPEG 4 Audio. AAC or M4A file quality is better and file sizes smaller compared to MP3 files.

## Native Chinese Pronounciation

The following is what I will use as my benchmark. Its a lady's voice and since she is a professional Chinese teacher I thought she'd be best to start with. Until I find a way to put the track on this wesite, you will have to listen to her on SoundCloud.

After going through the text, understanding it, and practising it, here is my recording on SoundCloud as usual.
