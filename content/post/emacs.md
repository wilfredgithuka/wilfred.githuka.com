Ever since I went deep into Linux in 2015, I have heard of emacs being 
mentioned  as the holy grail of Linux text editing. I must admit but it
looked messy and had to grasp.

Early this year I came accross Spacemacs and it looked interesting but
just like emacs I gave it a glance and planned to give it more time.

A month ago I saw my pal [Raymond](https://github.com/rwanyoike) navigate his 
Linux box effortlessly using a similar software appearance quicly editing and 
opening files in what seemed like a spectactular fun. All this without 
touching or even glancing at the keyboard. It was amazing. He later told me 
he was using Spacemacs. I was hooked :-)

I googled some more and once it became clear to me, there was no turning back. 
Spacemacs was derrived from GNU Emacs and since I was introduced to spacemacs 
before Emacs, I just learnt a few tricks and I got the hang of it.

Below are my most common commands that I use daily as I learn more. I think
knowing all the tools require alot of time and practise.

* m-m-f-e-R - Save the spacemacs config file
* m-m-f-s - Save a file
* m-b-d - Kill that buffer
* m-f-f - Open a file

As I learn more on spacemacs I will share on what I think is cool and can 
improve productivity.

Also check out this Raymond's [repo](https://githun.com/rwanyoike/dotfiles) that
contains great spacemacs layers and configs.

Thats all for now :-)
