## Machine Learning for dummies — explained in 3 mins!

Yash Soni has written a great article about the basics of ML (Machine Learning) In his article he mentions about the common applications of ML i our day to day lives:

* Your personal Assistant Siri or Google uses ML.
* Weather predictions for the next week comes using ML.

## Self-driving cars will affect everything you know

Autonomous vs Traditional intersection

Aniket has written a noteworthy article about how self driving cars will affect everything we know. Here is an excerpt:

Lyft and Uber will be our go-to when it comes to moving from point A to point B. In an ideal world, where no one owns a car, everyone requests a ride through their phone. This means that the ride-sharing companies would own the cars themselves and manage them in fleets. These fleets would most likely be in dedicated parking lots which would serve as distribution centers. We’ll also rarely see cars sitting idle — they’ll always be on a route to some destination rather than being parked by a sidewalk, at a shopping mall, in a garage, and so on. When a car drops someone off, it goes on to the next customer or back to the distribution center for service or layoff during non-peak hours. Cars will be utilized more, but they’ll take up less space.

Thats all for this week, have a great week ahead and stay safe while experimenting on self driving cars.
