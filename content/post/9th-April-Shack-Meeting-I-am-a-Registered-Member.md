Today was my first time to attend a shack meeting and generally it was very informative. The meeting was at the 5Z4RS Station Beacon in Woodley Estate,Nairobi. This location is referred to as the Shack. On my way I was wondering who and what type of people I would find. The meeting was scheduled to start at 10.00AM. On arrival I found Mr.Ted Alleyne together with another gentle man doing some preparations. Inside the room which stood on the side of the small piece of land, was like entering into a Museum. Wall hangings of old and great awards together with electronics reminded me that this has been running for a long time. The outside was totally opposite of the inside. At the center of the room was a table with magazines and meeting documents. The gentlemen were very kind and we talked for a long time.

After the introductions, we got down to the stuff. Mr Ted took me through the registration process and after filling in the forms, paying a fee of Ksh.250, he continued to give me a brief of how the Radio Society of Kenya came to be. Other members started coming in one by one and after some brief introductions the meeting started.

# New Members Registration
Today I got registered as a student member and all agreed, so thank you :-)

# Examinations
The Novice and Professional exams will be held in May and December respectively. I will start with the Novice and then go pro by December.

# Shack Fence Repair
Apparently there are some intrusions in the shack's fence. The hole is enough for a person to move with ease. However to fix this we have to get a permission from the County Council of Nairobi.Same for the Acacia tree that is bending to much and seems like it will fall one day.

# Economics
Members were looking into the idea of allowing a business premise to run on the shacks compound so that the rent fee will be used to pay the land rates and keep the place tidy.
