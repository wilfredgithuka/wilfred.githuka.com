There is nothing good -and awesome- like a well written manual or post to a problem which is
well explained and above all is available to read offline.

Am an offline advocate and as much as I write on this website, I like to read stuff
offline. Go to the website, download the post, article etc and read it when am not
busy. Normally, to do this I have to save the website, link or snapshot the site which is to the
very least, tedious.

I want my readers to be able to download the article in a pdf format which they can opt
to view it in the browser or download it to read later. The file should be small in size,
hopefully even with images and it should render in less than 200kB. I also plan for it to 
be at best one page with margins very tight and text at size:10. I know thats abit too small
but it shall still be readable.

## LaTeX

Enter LaTeX. I have had some experience with LaTeX before back in 2018 and its a powerful
documentation system. Its OpenSource and it can produce documents to rival any WYSIWYG editor
in the market.

In the early stages of this project I will be producing the downloadable files during
production of the article/manual. However in future this process will be automated such that
when the reader clicks on the [Download PDF](https://images.githuka.com/minimalist_pdf.pdf) script in executed
internally and does all the work.

Thats the plan,

Thank you for reading
